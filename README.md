# Financial-Education-Application

## Overview
This project was developed together with a classmate for a high school contest. The application was designed to help children learn a few things about financial education. 

Note: the source code and the application's interface are written in Romanian. It's important to highlight that the code, being one of my earlier works, is notably old and cumbersome. A comparison with my more recent projects showcases the substantial improvements in my coding practices and project development skills.

## Features


## Technologies used

## Screenshots
**Note: The GUI was not a primary concern during the development of this project.**
