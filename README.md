# Financial-Education-Application

## Overview
This project was developed together with a classmate for a high school contest. The application was designed an introduction to financial education for children. 

Note: the source code and the application's interface are written in Romanian. It's important to highlight that the code, being one of my earlier works, is notably old and cumbersome. A comparison with my more recent projects showcases the substantial improvements in my coding practices and project development skills.

## Technologies used
- C#
- Windows Forms for the GUI

## Screenshots
**Note: The GUI was not a primary concern during the development of this project.**
